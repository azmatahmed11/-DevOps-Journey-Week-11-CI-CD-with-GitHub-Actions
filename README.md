ðŸš€ DevOps Journey â€“ Week 11: CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This week I explored GitHub Actions and successfully automated the deployment of my Node.js application to AWS EC2.

Unlike Jenkins, where we need to install and configure servers with webhooks, GitHub Actions makes the process very smooth â€” everything is managed inside a simple .yml workflow file. No extra server installation is required.

ðŸ”§ What I did:

Built a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions.

Automated deployment to AWS EC2.

Solved multiple pipeline errors during setup.

Exposed the app on port 3000 by configuring EC2 security groups.

GitHub Actions is a powerful yet simple CI/CD tool that helps me automate deployments without extra overhead.

ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaway

Automation is the backbone of DevOps â€” and GitHub Actions makes it easier than ever.
